# PCEDK
PC Engine Dev Kit  

SDK for PC-Engine with Higueul language  
This is an SDK that aims to have an efficient compilation.  
You can have a code as quickly with higueul as by writing it in full asm.  
While having a "C-like" syntax.  

The SDK is in stable version 0.2  
To test please download in the release section  
And launch higueulc  
For more details please read the wiki.  

You can learn Higueulc, by reading the example source code, but it has some differences with C, so I advise you to read the wiki:  
https://github.com/Kannagi/Higueul/wiki

If you have problems with the language or the SDK
